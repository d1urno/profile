title: About me
---

I spent more than a decade mastering technologies like Typescript, Java, NodeJs, Vue/Nuxt, React, GraphQL, REST, TanStack, Tailwind, Docker, Prisma, Cloudflare, Gitflow, offline-first data and mono-repos. I recently realised my real passion isn’t about the tech itself, it’s **how people feel when they touch what I create**, the engagement, the inspiration, the experience.

Whether it was by tweaking Minecraft servers as a teenager, or by producing electronic music to shape a mood, or by combining different flavours in my kitchen, or while building software in my engineering career, the goal was never just elegant logic; it was about providing unique experiences. Writing quality code was simply the vehicle for that to happen.

Nowadays that vehicle is changing rapidly, so I’m leaning deeper into my same purpose by transitioning from a _Full-stack Developer_ to a _Product Engineer_, embracing AI’s exponential leverage, with special code linting rules, agent workflows, rule generators, MCP servers, prompt and context management, feature templates and RAG systems. This toolkit, plus my extensive experience in the field, enables me to guide AI efficiently while iterating through big scale application codebases. Ultimately turning big ideas into reliable world-class interactions at speed and scale.

So, what drives me now? Turning product visions into polished experiences, micro-interactions, motion, AI-powered features, then shipping them fast with metrics that prove the magic.

If your roadmaps need someone who can help deliver quality from a database schema to the final success toast, or your team needs a leader who can guide the path to get there, [let’s talk!](mailto:d1urno@gmx.com 'let’s talk!')
