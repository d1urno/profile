This was a remote project where we build a fully fledged institutional website. Focused both on backend and frontend using Drupal Headless, GraphQL API. Frontend using NuxtJS with Vuex, i18n for internationalization, TailwindCSS, static generated configuration (JAMStack) and my own open-source [NuxtJS module](https://github.com/d1urno/nuxt-image-extractor "NuxtJS module") which was starred by Sebastien Chopin.
