Full time front-end lead developer, app architect using Apollo Graphql, Mapbox and TypeScript, Vue 3 composition API (pnpm monorepo architecture), TailwindCSS, and Vite. During this period, I've mentored other developers, designed code principles and conventions to improve our efficiency, and collaborated actively with the product and design teams to find the best possible user experience.
