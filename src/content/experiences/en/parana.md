This was a remote project involving the institutinal website of the bank, with a brief onsite period in Curitiba, Brazil. I was leading the project while also having focus on its backend with Drupal Headless exposing GraphQL endpoints and DevOps tasks with CI/CD in cooperation with Bank's developer team. Contributed minimally on frontend with my team using React (Hooks, Styled components, Redux) and Apollo Client.
