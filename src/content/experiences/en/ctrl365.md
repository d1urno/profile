Onsite agency in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. During this period I was responsible for many different tasks, such as responsive landing pages for brands like Acer, Consul or Nestle in parallel with design department. I've built a complete Intranet with authentication and push notifications, and APIs with database administration panels. I did many job interviews with candidates to grow our team, among other team management responsibilities.
